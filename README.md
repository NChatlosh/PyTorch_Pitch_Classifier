# PyTorch_Pitch_Classifier
This project makes use of the PyTorch machine learning library to create a simple DNN that learns to classify pitch from audio files. I have started out with a very simple set of audio files. Each is a half-second long, normalized, mono (1 channel), and consists of a single waveform. I used a variety of simple sine, sawtooth, triangle, and square waves generated from the operator synthesizer in Ableton Live. I first attempted to create the network using just numpy, but the math wasn't working out quite right and I wanted to create more sophisticated layers for future iterations. This network performs much better than expected and can produce the correct predictions veyr quickly. I plan on moving on to more detailed and sophisticated instrumetns and sounds for the next iteration on this project and try to push the limits, perhaps eventually moving onto stereo (2 channel) audio.
